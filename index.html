                            <p class="article-description">In contemporary debates regarding Muslim identity in South Asia no issue is as prominent or as hotly contested as the character and social role of Islamic law. Though the controversies are directly relevant to present day concerns the questions themselves are neither new nor innocent of colonial influence. The existing corpus of Islamic law in the subcontinent owes a great deal to the legacy of colonial jurists who systematised and gave shape to Anglo-Muhammadan law over many decades. In this essay the history of Anglo-Muhammadan scholarship is considered in light of the colonial need for precise and reliable information about indigenous laws. In their preference for textual sources the courts were inclined to endorse highly orthodox forms of Islamic law which were applied more widely and rigorously than in the pre-colonial period ultimately contributing to a new politics of Muslim identity in the twentieth century.</p>

The Taliban regime which President Bush deplored as an enemy which “aids terrorists” and “barbaric criminals who profane a great religion by commiting murder in its name” is using and reprinting American-funded materials to propagate its radical ideology among the Afghan youth.3 Why would the United States fund textbooks that promote a dangerous message antithetical to American values?</p>
